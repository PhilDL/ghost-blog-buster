# Introduction

`@ts-ghost/core-api` contains the core building blocks for the `@ts-ghost/content-api` package. It contains the Type-safe logic of Query Builder and Fetchers. Unless you are building a new package for `@ts-ghost` you should not need to use this package directly.

## Install

```shell
pnpm i @ts-ghost/core-api
```

### Requirements

This client is only compatible with Ghost versions 5.x for now.

- Ghost 5^

- Node.js 16+
  - We rely on global `fetch` being available, so you can bring your own
    polyfill and if you run Node 16, you'll need to run with the
    `--experimental-fetch` flag enabled.
