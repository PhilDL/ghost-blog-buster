# Introduction

`@ts-ghost/admin-api` provides a strongly-typed TypeScript client to interract with the Ghost Admin API based on [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schemas passed through all operations on composed API endpoints, `read`, `browse`, `add`, `edit` and `delete`.

This client gives you Type-Safety in the **inputs and outputs** of your Ghost API calls, usable in the browser (not recommended since you will probably expose your Admin API Key) or in Node.js.

It is made to interract with the Ghost Admin API with authentication by key. File uploads are not supported yet.

## Requirements

This client is only compatible with Ghost versions 5.x for now.

- Ghost 5.^ (Any Ghost version after 5.0)

- Node.js 16+
  - We rely on global `fetch` being available, so you can bring your own
    polyfill and if you run Node 16, you'll need to run with the
    `--experimental-fetch` flag enabled.
- TypeScript 5+, the lib make usage of const in generics and other TS5+ features.
