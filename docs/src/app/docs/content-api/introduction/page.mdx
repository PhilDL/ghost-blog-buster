# Introduction

`@ts-ghost/content-api` provides a strongly-typed TypeScript client to interract with the Ghost Content API based on [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schemas passed through the APIComposer that exposes `read` and `browse` methods with safe params and then a Fetcher.

## Install

```shell
pnpm i @ts-ghost/content-api
```

### Requirements

This client is only compatible with Ghost versions 5.x for now.

- Ghost 5^

- Node.js 16+
  - We rely on global `fetch` being available, so you can bring your own
    polyfill and if you run Node 16, you'll need to run with the
    `--experimental-fetch` flag enabled.
