# Fetching

Fetching happens at the end of your chaining of methods, the moment you call the async `fetch` method (or the async `paginate`).

Technically these are the only asynchronous methods and the only moment where the library will make a request to the Ghost API through the platform `fetch` function (in Node or in the browser).

## Reminder requirements

This library expect the global `fetch` function to be available. If you are using Node 16, you will need to run with the `--experimental-fetch` flag enabled.

## fetch options

Since we are using the standard `fetch` you have can pass options of type [`RequestInit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) notably to play with the `cache` behavior.

For example:

```ts
let query = await api.posts
  .browse({
    limit: 5,
    order: "title DESC",
  })
  .fetch({
    cache: "no-cache",
  });
```

### With NextJS

In a NextJS 13+ project, `fetch` is augmented and you can fully take advantage of that and you have access to the `next` option.

```ts
let query = await api.posts
  .browse({
    limit: 5,
    order: "title DESC",
  })
  .fetch({ next: { revalidate: 10 } }); // NextJS revalidate this data every 10 seconds at most
```
