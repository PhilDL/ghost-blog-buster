# Browse

The `browse` method is used to get a list of items from the Ghost API, it is the equivalent of the `GET /posts` endpoint. You have access to different options to paginate, limit, filter and order your results.

## Options

These options are totally _optionals_ on the `browse` method but they let you filter and order your search.

This is an example containing all the available keys in the params object

```typescript
let query = api.posts.browse({
  page: 1,
  limit: 5,
  filter: "name:bar+slug:-test",
  //      ^? the text here will throw a TypeScript lint error if you use unknown fields.
  order: "title DESC",
  //      ^? the text here will throw a TypeScript lint error if you use unknown fields.
});
```

These browse params are then parsed through a `Zod` Schema that will validate all the fields.

- `page:number` The current page requested
- `limit:number` Between 0 and 15 (limitation of the Ghost API)
- `filter:string` Contains the filter with [Ghost API `filter` syntax](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/#filtering).
- `order:string` Contains the name of the field and the order `ASC` or `DESC`.

For the `order` and `filter` if you use fields that are not present on the schema (for example `name` on a `Post`) then the methods will throw an Error with message containing the unknown field.
