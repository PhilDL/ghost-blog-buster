# Introduction

`@ts-ghost/content-api` provides a strongly-typed TypeScript client to interract with the **Ghost Content API** based on [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schemas passed through an APIComposer that exposes different resources and their `read` or `browse` methods (dependening on the resource) with params and output type-safety.

All the available options from the Ghost Content API are available here, filtering, ordering, pagination, selecting fields, modifiying output, etc...

## Requirements

This client is only compatible with Ghost versions 5.x for now.

- Ghost 5.^ (Any Ghost version after 5.0)

- Node.js 16+
  - We rely on global `fetch` being available, so you can bring your own
    polyfill and if you run Node 16, you'll need to run with the
    `--experimental-fetch` flag enabled.
- TypeScript 5+, the lib make usage of const in generics and other TS5+ features.
