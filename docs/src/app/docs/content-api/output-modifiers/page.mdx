# Output modifiers

## Select specific fields with `.fields()`

The `fields` method lets you change the output of the result to have only your selected fields, it works by giving an object with the field name and the value `true`. Under the hood it will use the `zod.pick` method to pick only the fields you want.

```typescript
let result = await api.posts
  .read({
    slug: "typescript-is-cool",
  })
  .fields({
    id: true,
    slug: true,
    title: true,
  })
  .fetch();

if (result.success) {
  const post = result.data;
  //     ^? type {"id": string; "slug":string; "title": string}
}
```

The **output schema** will be modified to only have the fields you selected and TypeScript will pick up on that to warn you if you access non-existing fields.

## Include relations with `.include()`

The `include` method lets you include some additionnal data that the Ghost API doesn't give you by default. The `include` params is specific to each resource and is defined in the "include" `Schema` of the resource. You will have to let TypeScript guide you to know what you can include.

```typescript
let result = await api.authors
  .read({
    slug: "phildl",
  })
  .include({ "count.posts": true })
  .fetch();
```

Available include keys by resource:

- Posts & Pages: `authors`, `tags`
- Authors: `count.posts`
- Tags: `count.posts`
- Tiers: `monthly_price`, `yearly_price`, `benefits`

The output type will be modified to make the fields you include **non-optionals**.

## Output page/post content into different `.formats()`

The `formats` method lets you add alternative content formats on the output of `Post` or `Page` resource to get the content in `plaintext` or `html`. Available options are `plaintext | html | mobiledoc`.

```typescript
let result = await api.posts
  .read({
    slug: "this-is-a-post-slug",
  })
  .formats({
    plaintext: true,
    html: true,
  })
  .fetch();
```

The output type will be modified to make the formatted fields you include **non-optionals**.
