# Output modifiers

Output modifiers are available for the `read` and `browse` methods. They let you change the output of the result to have only your selected fields, include some additionnal data that the Ghost API doesn't give you by default or get the content in different formats.

The result type from the subsequent `fetch` will be modified to match your selection giving you full type-safety.

```ts /fields({ title: true })/
// Example with read...
let result = await api.posts.read({ slug: "slug"}).fields({ title: true }).fetch();

// ... and with browse
let result = await api.posts.browse({limit: 2}).fields({ title: true }).fetch();
```

## Select specific fields with `.fields()`

The `fields` method lets you change the output of the result to have only your selected fields, it works by giving an object with the field name and the value `true`. Under the hood it will use the `zod.pick` method to pick only the fields you want.

```ts
let result = await api.posts
  .read({
    slug: "typescript-is-cool",
  })
  .fields({
    id: true,
    slug: true,
    title: true,
  })
  .fetch();

if (result.success) {
  const post = result.data;
  //     ^? type {"id": string; "slug":string; "title": string}
}
```

The **output schema** will be modified to only have the fields you selected and TypeScript will pick up on that to warn you if you access non-existing fields.

## Include relations with `.include()`

The `include` method lets you include some additionnal data that the Ghost API doesn't give you by default. The `include` params is specific to each resource and is defined in the "include" `Schema` of the resource. You will have to let TypeScript guide you to know what you can include.

```ts
let result = await api.authors
  .read({
    slug: "phildl",
  })
  .include({ "count.posts": true })
  .fetch();
```

Available include keys by resource:

- Posts & Pages: `authors`, `tags`
- Authors: `count.posts`
- Tags: `count.posts`
- Tiers: `monthly_price`, `yearly_price`, `benefits`

The output type will be modified to make the fields you include **non-optionals**.

## Output page/post content into different `.formats()`

The `formats` method lets you add alternative content formats on the output of `Post` or `Page` resource to get the content in `plaintext` or `html`. Available options are `plaintext | html | mobiledoc`.

```ts
let result = await api.posts
  .read({
    slug: "this-is-a-post-slug",
  })
  .formats({
    plaintext: true,
    html: true,
  })
  .fetch();
```

The output type will be modified to make the formatted fields you include **non-optionals**.
