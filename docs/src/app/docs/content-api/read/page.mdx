# Read

Read is used to fetch 1 resource using an identity field, usually `id`, `slug` or `email`. The Identity field is defined in the `Schema` of the resource. And will be autocompleted at usage.

## Options

```typescript
let query = api.posts.read({
  id: "edHks74hdKqhs34izzahd45"
});

// or

let query = api.posts.read({
  slug: "typescript-is-awesome-in-2025"
});
```

You can submit **both** `id` and `slug`, but the fetcher will then chose the `id` in priority if present to make the final URL query to the Ghost API.
